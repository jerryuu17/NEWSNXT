# 📢 NEWSnxt – Crowd-Sourced News Platform

### 🌍 Democratizing News with People’s Voices & AI Verification

---

## 📖 Overview

**NEWSnxt** is a next-generation **crowd-sourced news platform** where real people become reporters of their surroundings.
Users can post news happening in their locality, and people within a **5 km radius** can **verify its authenticity** by voting **True** or **False**.

If a news item crosses a **trust threshold**, it gets **published to the platform**.

Alongside crowd-sourced news, **NEWSnxt integrates trusted global news APIs**, making it a **hybrid platform** of professional + community news.

We also use an **AI/ML model** for verification support and provide multilingual accessibility with support for **10+ Indian languages**.

## 📊 Workflow

1. **User posts news** with location data.
2. **Nearby users** (within 5 km) receive a verification request.
3. Votes **True/False** determine credibility.
4. If **threshold reached → published** on main feed.
5. **ML Model** cross-verifies authenticity.
6. Users **earn points** for posting/verifying.
7. **News API integration** ensures hybrid content.
